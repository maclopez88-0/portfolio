 <h1>Hello! My name is <strong>Cesar Lopez</strong> and welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
 <p>As you scroll further down, you will see a few projects I created while taking <em>Epicodus's Intro to Programming</em> course!</p>

 <h2>Here are two projects on a numbered list. If you click on them, you should be taken to their repositories!</h2>
 <div class="enjoyed">
  <ol>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/maclopez88-0/my-first-webpage/tree/main">My <strong>first</strong> web page!</a></li>
     <p>This webpage was creating using block and inline elements in HTML.</p>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/maclopez88-0/dog-website">Our dog website</a></li> 
     <p>This was a quick project I worked on with a friend on my dev team. We primarily wanted to practice using paths in html to add the image as well as forking on github</p>
  </ol> 
 </div>
 

 <h2>These next two projects are on a bullet point list. Each one will also take you to their repositories!</h2>
 <div class="least-enjoyed">
   <!--I enjoyed creating these as well, just needed to think of a div class place holder!-->
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/maclopez88-0/my-first-webpage/tree/main">My favorite places.</a></li>
    <p>This project was created using a stylesheet to style our HTML file.</p>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/maclopez88-0/cupcake-shop">Cupcake shop website.</a></li>
    <p>This project was created using HTML and CSS. Here we began to learn about box models and floating.</p>
  </ul>

 <h3>About me!</h3>
 <img class="selfie" src="img/clselfie.jpg" alt="A very recent image of myself.">
 <div class="column">
  <p>I have been working in the customer experience field for over <a href="img/mindblown.jpg" alt="mind blown">10 years now</a>! I genuinely enjoy helping other people and the sense of accomplishment I receive after trying my best to resolve an issue is next to no other; however, customer contact can be rough which is why I am considering changing career paths into programming. With programming, I can still work on finding creative solutions and work-arounds to resolve bugs, while continuing to learn the many ins-and-outs of programming. While I am not at work, I <span class="love">love</span> to spend my free time listening to podcasts, playing video games, cooking up a nice meal to enjoy with the family, deciphering rap albums, taking my dog Xena on walks and hiking/camping all around the PNW. </p>
