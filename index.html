 <h1>Hello! My name is <strong>Cesar Lopez</strong> and welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
 <p>As you scroll further down, you can see a few of the projects I have created while taking <em>Epicodus's Intro to Programming course</em>!</p>

 <h2>Here are the top two project's I enjoyed making the most. If you click on them, you should be taken to their repository!</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/maclopez88-0/my-first-webpage/tree/main">My <strong>first</strong> web page!</a></li>
    <p>This webpage was creating using html</p>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/maclopez88-0/dog-website">Our dog website</a></li> 
    <p>This was a quick project I worked on with a friend in my dev team. We primarily wanted to practice using paths in html to add the image as well as to practice forking on github</p>
  </ol> 
 <h2>Here are two more projects in no particular order</h2>
 <ul>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/maclopez88-0/my-first-webpage/tree/main">My favorite places.</a></li>
   <p>This project was created with html.</p>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/maclopez88-0/cupcake-shop">Cupcake shop website.</a></li>
   <p>This project was created using more html and revolved a little bit more around experimenting with the box model and styelsheet.</p>
 </ul>
